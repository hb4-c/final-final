  <p>Luis Alfredo is one of the best chefs in Heidi's restaurant. He is a Mexican Italian born and raised in italy. He started cooking at a young age after he found out her grandpas famous recepie to make chocolate brownies. The first time he tried them he fell in love.He would beg his grandma every day for the recepie but his grandpa would refuse and repeat to him each time that he was too young and once he grew up he would be able to know her recepie. Luis Alfredo was determined to find that recepie and one day he finally had it in his hands. Since that day he pledged to share his dishes with the world so that they could too have a piece of hapiness. A nice fact to know about Luis Alberto is that if anyone asks him for the recepie he will make his best effort to explain the recepie yet he will change some ingredients otherwise the recepies would loose its value. .</p>
